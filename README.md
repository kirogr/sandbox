# Sandbox Malware Analysis by Kiril Grigoriev

This project was developed inspired by the software and cyber engineering major (883589) by the multidisciplinary Amal Lady Davis High School.

# What's the purpose of this project?

My project's goal is to establish a secure online platform for analyzing suspicious information, similar to a virtual lab for studying malware. This will enable us to understand how malicious programs operate without putting our computers at risk, ultimately bolstering our defense against online attacks. In this project, I have shown a proof-of-concept of using Process Monitor by Sysinternals driver to display to the user's more assertive and interactive way.
